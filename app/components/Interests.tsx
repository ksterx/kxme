                My interests are deeply rooted in Reinforcement Learning, Image Processing, Natural Language Processing, and Multimodal Processing. Leveraging these technologies, I aspire to integrate AI seamlessly into society, freeing humans from laborious tasks. This, I believe, will enable us to focus on living curiosity-driven, emotionally rich lives, pursuing qualitative happiness to its fullest extent.
